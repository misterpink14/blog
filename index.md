# Welcome to My Blog!

I'm a recent graduate from BYU (go Cougars!) and software developer for The Experience Management Platform, [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/). 

This blog is intended to be a way to remind future me about the things that I've learned. I tend to spend way to much time Googling the same thing over and over again. I end up navigating multiple tutorials and aggregating information from them to learn something. Hopefully this will help save more time for someone other than myself.

I intend on displaying information in a format that suits me, hopefully it will also help a few other people out as well. As such, each blog post is mostly just notes about a specific topic. My eventual goal is to make this blog-worthy; but, for now, it will be pretty rough.
